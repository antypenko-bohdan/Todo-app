[Add a link to your demo here if available]

## Technologies used

* React.js
* TypeScript
* Fetch, REST API
* classnames
* React Transition Group
* CSS

## Structure

The app is built using functional components and React Hooks. Each component is abstract and fully reusable. CSS classes are used to style the app, with conditional styling applied using the classnames library.

## Features & Functionality

* React Transition Group

## Project Structure

* `App.tsx`: Main component orchestrating the application logic

* `TodoItem.tsx`: Represents an individual todo item
* `TodoFilter.tsx`: Provides filtering options for the todos
* `api/todos.ts`: Handles API calls for CRUD operations on todos

## Reflections

This project demonstrates proficiency in building a single-page application using React and TypeScript. It showcases the ability to work with REST APIs, handle different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE), and implement error handling.

The use of React Transition Group for animations adds a polished feel to the user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

State management is handled efficiently using React's built-in hooks, demonstrating a good understanding of React's state management capabilities without the need for additional libraries.

## Future Improvements

* Implement user authentication
* Add due dates for todos
* Introduce categories or tags for better organization
* Implement a dark mode theme
